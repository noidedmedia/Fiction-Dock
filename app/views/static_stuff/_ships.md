Fiction Dock ships are incredibly fully-featured.
They allow not only for cross-franchise ships, but also ships with more than two characters.

So, when should you put characters into ships? Follow these guidelines.

1. Characters should be in a ship if they are in a romantic relationship, or if they have some kind of romantic attraction.
"Crushes" may be enough for a ship tag, if the crush is significent to the overall plot of the story.
2. The relationship must be significent to the plot of the story.
If you mention that The Pyro and The Heavy are totally in love in one sentence of your Team Fortress 2 fic, do not tag that.
3. All characters in the ship must be in love with each other.
Love triangles, where multiple characters pursue a common character, should be represented as multiple ships.
