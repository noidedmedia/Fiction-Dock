FictionDock is a website for Fan Fiction---that is, stories written in worlds and with characters created by other people.
As such, we need to know what world (or worlds) your story is set in.
FictionDock organizes those worlds into Franchises.

It's useful to first start with our qualifications for a Franchise.

1. A franchise encompasses all media published in a particular world.
For example, the *Star Wars* expanded universe material is in the same franchise as the *Star Wars* movies. 
2. Stories set in a unique universe are considered to be a distinct Franchise, even if the characters and general scenario are similar. 
For example, the series of *Batman* films directed by Christopher Nolan are a distinct Franchise from the *Arkham* games, which are in turn distinct from the series of comic books published by DC.


Now, you're writing a story, and wish to add Franchises.
In order to do that, you know probably know the qualifications for doing so:

1. The franchise must appear in the story in some significent way. 
The characters stepping through a wardrobe and into Narnia, then immediately back out, is not enough to qualify adding the *Chronicles of Narnia* franchise to the story.
