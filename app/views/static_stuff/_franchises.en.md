Fiction Dock is a website for Fan Fiction---that is, stories written in worlds and with characters created by other people.
As such, we need to know what world (or worlds) your story is set in.
Fiction Dock organizes those worlds into Franchises.

It's useful to first start with our qualifications for a Franchise.

1. A franchise encompasses all media published in a particular world.
For example, the *Star Wars* expanded universe material is in the same franchise as the *Star Wars* movies. 
2. Stories set in a unique universe are considered to be a distinct Franchise, even if the characters and general scenario are similar. 
For example, the series of *Batman* films directed by Christopher Nolan are a distinct Franchise from the *Arkham* games, which are in turn distinct from the series of comic books published by DC.


If you want to add a Franchise to your story, remember: the franchise must be present in a *significant way*. 
We define *significant* as follows:

1. The Franchise must actually appear.
Randomly tagging stores with unrelated franchises is a good way to get banned.
2. The Franchise must play some kind of role that is central to the plot.
Throwaway gags, such as the characters walking through a wardrobe into Narnia and immediately back out, do not count.
3. The Franchise must be recognizable. 
If a character finds a normal crowbar, but it's actually Gordon Freeman's crowbar, you still cannot add the *Half-Life* Franchise unless the fact that the crowbar belongs to Gordon plays a significent role in the story.
