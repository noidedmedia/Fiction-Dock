A character is, in truth, rather tricky to define. 
We use the following criteria:

1. Characters are based primarily on personality.
Any radical personality changes may be counted as a different character, if these changes appear in the actual canon properties of the Franchise.
2. Body changes are, in the general case, not counted as a different character.

Now, when should you tag a character in your story?
Well, follow these guidelines:

1. The character must appear in a significant percentage of your story.
If Gordon Freeman appears in only one chapter of your 70-chapter *Half Life* story, he should not be tagged.
2. The character needs to be recognizable.
If you change the personality and appearence of a character, it is no longer the character.
