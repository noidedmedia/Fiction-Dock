FictionDock aims to be a place where anybody can write stories.
We don't want to censor your writing.
However, we need to keep FictionDock organized and orderly, in order to make it easier to use for everybody.

As a result, we've came up with a few simple guidelines.
Please, read through this guide before participating in FictionDock.
