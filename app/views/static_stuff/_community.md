- The golden rule is: don't be a jerk.
- Criticism is not being a jerk if it is constructive.
Here is an example of non-constructive criticism:

> YOUR STORY IS DUMB AND BAD AND YOU ARE DUMB AND BAD

And here's an example of constructive criticism:

> Your story really needs to work on the characterization of The Pyro.
> I don't think there is any situation where sh- h- they would actually put out a fire, especially not just because "it's unsafe"

Note that you don't necessarily need to be polite.
You just need to be mildly civil.
